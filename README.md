Chatty is a chatting application where you can chat just like you would on any other website!!

But that's not important here!

It does that using a microservice :bangbang:
 
This is the main app for User interaction,

The background messaging is handled by a [microservice](https://github.com/ashish173/messaging_service).

This [main app](https://github.com/ashish173/chatty) uses a gem to interact with the microservice.

It can be found in the `vendor/gems` directory link to [interface_gem](https://github.com/ashish173/messaging_service_gem).

ENjoii.. :fire:
